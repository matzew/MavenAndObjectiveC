This is a simple demo project, to test the Maven NAR plugin.

The plugin is located here:
https://github.com/duns/maven-nar-plugin

The goal is to compile Objective-C code through the well-defined Maven build process....

= = = GETTING STARTED = = = 
a) you may need to compile the NAR plugin (and its dependencies)
b) to run this project, just issue 'mvn clean install'

NOTE: THIS PROJECT compiles a library... not an executable...
